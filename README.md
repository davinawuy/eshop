<h2>Reflection 1</h2>

I have learned alot about clean code practices from the slides and lectures. Many practices I found most practical was naming conventions. I also applied the idea of separation of concern through Spring Boot's separation of concern. Finally, I also applied SRP or single responsibility functions to isolate each function or need to a single function to ease development. 

As for security practices I believe that the Thymeleaf aspect provides some form of encoding protection. Other than that in the getters and setters there are basic access restriction so that objects are not easily modified.

There are some points of possible improvement in the code such as the findid function could have better exception handling incase it is not found. I should also implement better validation upon updates to ensure the inputted value is valid.
